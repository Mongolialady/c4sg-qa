# C4SG Bare Repo

This repository stores Selenium code and supporting docs. Projects will contain the current issues and tasks people are working on. The wiki will include test cases, test plans; etc. If you have a test case, create a branch for merging and add code to it. Name the branch after the test case. This will be established in the Test Plans posted on the wiki. As for bugs, name them after the bug. If you are reviewing a feature, create a post in the project regarding this. Thanks.
